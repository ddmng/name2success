# name2success
Study on if, and how, names conditioned success of a web site or a software product.



##Why?
Simple: I need a name for a side project and I want to know more about how much a good name plays a success role for a product or a site and what characteristics have in common "good names".

##Notes about the classification
All this stuff is strictly related to the way I perceived the story of that site or software, so it doesn't represent in any way an official explanation of how things went for that thing.

###Contribute
For the above reason, feel free to fork this project and ask a pull request if you have something interesting to add.

## How it's organized
First of all, I try to list all the ways the sites/products reached success in the Internet market. Each "success cause" is assigned to the softwares/sites I analyzed in the final table.
