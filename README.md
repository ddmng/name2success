# name2success
Study on how names conditioned success of a web site or a software product.

It's basically a sigle file (this) with a list of software products and web sites  names, each one assigned to a different category. The categories describe the influx of the name in determining the fame of the product.  I chose to conduct the study only on the internet market stuff because it's the only market where I feel confident for doing such a research.

##Why?
Simple: I need a name for a side project and I want to know more about how much a good name plays a success role for a product or a site and what is a "good product'.

##About the classification
All this stuff is strictly linked to the way I perceived the story of that site or software, so it doesn't represent in any way an official explanation of how things went for that thing.

##Contribute
Feel free to fork this project and ask a pull request if you have something interesting to add.

## How it's organized
Sites and products names are represented in a table so that it's easier to compare the outcomes for each one. The tables will contain 'x' characters in the cells where I think that ....
