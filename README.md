# name2success
Study on how names conditioned success of a web site or a software product.

It's basically a sigle file (this) with a list of product names, each one assigned to a different category. The categories describe the influx of the name in determining the fame of the product.  I chose to conduct the study only over products of the internet market, because it's the only market where I feel confident for doing such a research.

##Why?
Simple: I need a name for a site
